Bugs:
	Somtimes asteroids spawn mid-screen
	Sometimes the last asteroid is lost.
		If asteroid count down to 2 or less check to see if they are all off screen.
	After an asteroid hits a ship the forward and backward jets stop working
	Dictionary based asteroid creation is not working properly and the 2nd and supsequent build.
		asteroid count is beint set to 1 instead of what's in the data dictionary


Fix Game Over - DONE - Refactor to use data dictionary
Add Health Bar back - DONE
	make health bar reset to ship initial health so when we have stronger ships it still works
	
FIRST - refactor to use resources to set a level. - Working
		Spawn timer, what objects spwn, how many.
		This will make levels change
		
		We could have a hell mode which never stops.
